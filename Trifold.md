Now as my number does not seem to significant, I will try to convert it into more people as I doubt many other species will grow.

### How many more humans?

3,000,000,000,000 - 30,234,694,400 = 2,969,765,300,000

2,969,765,300,000 * 2 (2 humans per tree) = 5,939,530,600,000

5,939,530,600,000 + 9,000,000,000 = 5,948,530,600,000

The U.N. predicts that in 2100 there will be 11,500,000,000 and that the world population will stop growing. But this is probably false as better healthcare will only come in developing countries if it is profitable as man of the governments there are way to poor to afford it, which means that only charity services will give them extra healthcare.

ROUNDLY!

if the world continues to double itself ever 100 years than, in 259,000 the world's oxygen will no longer be sufficient. Although as no one is inactive and resting and most exercise or spend energy at least once a day than it is most likely that the oxygen will no longer be sufficiant in 129,500.

5,948,530,600,000 / 11,500,000,000 = 517

517 / 2 (doubling) = 257 ish

257 x 100 = 257,000
So oxygen is not so much of a problem, I also dout that the world could even support that amount of people and by then (if things continue the way it is) the world's tree population would have decrease dramatically, as we loose and estimate of 18 million acres (or 28125 square miles) of trees every year.

https://www.livescience.com/27692-deforestation.html

In a healthy forest there are about 60 trees per acre.Since we loose 18 million acres per year: 18,000,000 x 60 = 1,080,000,000. So we loose 1,080,000,000 trees every year. If the U.N. estimate that there will be 11.5 billion people .

www.sbcounty.gov/calmast/sbc/html/healthy_forest.asp

2,969,765,300,000 - (2,500,000,000 / 2 (breathing rate)) (as I used 9 billion I will add 2.5) = 2,968,500,000,000

There are that many 'useless' (in my point of view) trees left, lefts find out how long it takes for them to be eradicated.

2,968,500,000,000 - 1,080,000,000X = 0 ; 2,968,500,000,000 = 1,080,000,000X ; 2,968,500,000,000 / 1,080,000,000 = X ; 2748.6 = X 

All of these trees will be gone in 2,748 years or most likely half of that as our population will have higher wood demands, and all these trees are not beatifull healthy adult trees.

### RESULTING in 1,374 years of trees left, it is only 20 generations ahead! ###
