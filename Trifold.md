Now as my number does not seem to significant, I will try to convert it into more people as I doubt many other species will grow.

### How many more humans?

3,000,000,000,000 - 30,234,694,400 = 2,969,765,300,000

2,969,765,300,000 * 2 (2 humans per tree) = 5,939,530,600,000

5,939,530,600,000 + 9,000,000,000 = 5,948,530,600,000

The U.N. predicts that in 2100 there will be 11,500,000,000 and that the world population will stop growing. But this is probably false as better healthcare will only come in developing countries if it is profitable as man of the governments there are way to poor to afford it, which means that only charity services will give them extra healthcare.

ROUNDLY!

if the world continues to double itself ever 100 years than, in 259,000 the world's oxygen will no longer be sufficient. Although as no one is inactive and resting and most exercise or spend energy at least once a day than it is most likely that the oxygen will no longer be sufficiant in 129,500.

5,948,530,600,000 / 11,500,000,000 = 517

517 / 2 (doubling) = 257 ish

257 x 100 = 257,000
