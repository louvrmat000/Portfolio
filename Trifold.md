Now as my number does not seem to significant, I will try to convert it into more people as I doubt many other species will grow.

### How many more humans?

3,000,000,000,000 - 30,234,694,400 = 2,969,765,300,000

2,969,765,300,000 * 2 (2 humans per tree) = 5,939,530,600,000

5,939,530,600,000 + 9,000,000,000 = 5,948,530,600,000
