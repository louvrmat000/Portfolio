## The oxygen of trees and how much is it? ##

### RULES (entry 1), October 26, 2018 ###

My research question is: How many trees do we need to sustain the current animal population?

I WILL be ignoring other photosynthetic plants.

I WILL not be subtracting oxygen for plants or vegetation as they produce their oxygen (except trees).

I WILL not be counting sea creatures (including crabs, lobsters, alligators, etc.) (they have algae).

I WILL not be counting insects.

My goal is not to get every species of animals but rather their genuses.

I WILL not be counting artic animals either.

My goal is to get a pretty precise answer and then compare it to the number of trees currently.

Every animal's breath will be taken as if they are at rest.

### Criterion B: Planning ###

Checklist:

Aesthetics will be added on later, but they will be added.

Cost: A lot of time.

User/ Audience: Anyone who wishes to learn about trees and our planet (6+ years old to understand).

Environmental considerations: this is for the environment, and we should strive for at least twice the number of trees here.

Function: This project's function is to make us learn about the environment, it will be hard to maintain the ideal number of trees since humans are greedy for wood. However, it is possible if enough effort is put in

Materials: Wood/ paper ironically to make the poster board.

Size/Content: There will be a number of trees REQUIRED to keep us from dying but apart from that nothing.

Impact: I want this to inspire people to help trees and plant some, no one wants to die from suffocation.

First up determining how much oxygen trees produce.

On average a tree produces 260 pounds of oxygen each year, or enough oxygen for two people.

Second, the most important animal, humans, how much oxygen do they breathe?

Humans use 7-8 liters a minute while resting. However since the air is 20% oxygen and our breath is 15% oxygen, we consume 5% of it or 1/4 of the oxygen in that air therefore out of 100% of air swallowed only 5% is used. 11000 (100% of the air breathed in) x 5% (oxygen used) = 550 litters.

A tree produces 260 pounds of oxygen each year. A human uses 550 litters a day x 365 (days in a year) is about 200750 litters a year. A tree produces enough oxygen for two people, so a tree produces about 401500 litters (200750 x 2) a year or 1100 litters (401500 / 360) a day.

### Entry 5, October 26, 2018 ###

#### General info ####

There are 3.04 trillion or 3,000,000,000,000 trees in the world.

There are about 7.6 billion or 7,600,000,000 people on earth since one tree produces enough oxygen for two people about 3.8 billion trees are needed to sustain just humans.\

### Entry 6 November 22, 2018 ###

#### close domesticated animals ####

There are about 900 million dogs

There are also 600 million cats

### Entry 7, November 22, 2018 ###

#### Livestock ####

Today there are about 1.5 billion cows on earth 

There are also 2 billion pigs

There are also 19 billion chikens

There are also 14 million camels
