# My personal project about trees #

## The oxygen of trees and how much is it? ##

### RULES (entry 1), October 26, 2018 ###

My reasearch question is: How many trees do we need to sustain the current animal propulation?

I WILL be ignoring other photosynthetic plants

I WILL not be subtracting oxygen for plants or vegetation as they produce their own oxygen (exept trees)

I WILL not be counting sea creatures (including crabs, lobsters etc.) (they have algue)

My goal is to get a pretty presise answer and then compare it to the number of trees currently

Any information here will be from google

First up determining how much oxygen trees produce 

how much oxygen do trees produce? 

On average a tree produces 260 pounds of oxygen each year!
