## Setup ##

### RULES (entry 1), October 26, 2018 ###

My research question is: How many trees do we need to sustain the current animal population?

I WILL be ignoring other photosynthetic plants.

I WILL not be subtracting oxygen for plants or vegetation as they produce their oxygen (except trees).

I WILL not be counting sea creatures (including crabs, lobsters, alligators, etc.) (they have algae).

I WILL not be counting insects.

My goal is not to get every species of animals but rather the ones who have an impact (at least 1,000,000 + individuals)

I WILL not be counting artic animals either.

My goal is to get a pretty precise answer and then compare it to the number of trees currently.

Every animal's breath will be taken as if they are at rest.

Please email me at: matthieu.louvrier@live.com if I forget something.

### Entry 2, November, 1st ###

### Criterion B: Planning ###

Checklist:

Aesthetics will be added on later, but they will be added.

Cost: A lot of time.

User/ Audience: Anyone who wishes to learn about trees and our planet.

Environmental considerations: this project is for awarness of the environment, and we should strive for at least twice the number of trees here.

Function: This project's function is to make us learn about the environment, it will be hard to maintain the ideal number of trees since humans are greedy for wood. However, it is possible if enough effort is put in.

Materials: Wood/ paper ironically to make the poster board.

Size/Content: There will be a number of trees REQUIRED to keep us from dying.

Impact: I want this to inspire people to plant and repect trees, no one wants to die from suffocation.

### November 31st ###

### Criterion C: Creating the solution ###

changes: 

- I switched it from life to only animal species on land due to intervening factors like photosynthetic plant, tiny bugs and sea animals

follow the plan to make the solution:

- I am steadily working towords my goal by working a little bit by a little bit

Demonstrating technical skills:

- I have perseverance because I did want to give up multiple times

- I have reasearching skill because this information isn't easy to find

- I can build a potfolio from nothing on a website.

Construct a logical plan:

- work with big animal population, work my way down so I don't spend more time than needed on something with a population 1,000,000 while I haven't done humans.

- get as close to the result as possible and make my personal project poster board.

### Criterion D: Evaluating ###

Impact of the solution:

- Raise awarness to potential lack of trees

How could it be improved:

- adding other photosynthetic plants

- adding more species

Success of the solution:

- It might get people to care about and plant trees

Design, Testing, Methods Development, Planning:

- I designed this website

- I tested multiple sources and found the best

- My methods could be improved however with my reasources I think this is the best.

- I planned to do the biggest animals first then work my way down

## Trees, Oxygen, and animals ##

### Entry 3, October 25, 2018 ###

First up determining how much oxygen trees produce.

On average a tree produces 260 pounds of oxygen each year, or enough oxygen for two people.

### Entry 4, October 26, 2018 ###

Second, the most important animal, humans, how much oxygen do they breathe?

Humans use 7-8 liters a minute while resting. However since the air is 20% oxygen and our breath is 15% oxygen, we consume 5% of it or 1/4 of the oxygen in that air therefore out of 100% of air swallowed only 5% is used. 11000 (100% of the air breathed in) x 5% (oxygen used) = 550 litters.

A tree produces 260 pounds of oxygen each year. A human uses 550 litters a day x 365 (days in a year) is about 200750 litters a year. A tree produces enough oxygen for two people, so a tree produces about 401500 litters (200750 x 2) a year or 1100 litters (401500 / 360) a day.

### Entry 5, October 26, 2018 ###

#### General info ####

There are 3.04 trillion or 3,000,000,000,000 trees in the world.

There are about 7.6 billion or 7,600,000,000 people on Earth now however, the human population is growing rapidly and it is estimated to be 9 billion in as soon as 2050 so I will use 9 billion rather than 7.6 billion. Since for every human half a tree is needed, 9,000,000,000 (number of humans estimated for 2050) x 0.5 (trees per human ratio) = 4,500,000,000 or 4.5 billion trees.

### Entry 6 November 22-23, 2018 ###

#### closest animals ####

There are about 900 million dogs in the world who breath 35 times per minute. 35 (breathing rate of dogs) / 20 (breathing rate of humans) = 1.75. Since there is half tree per human: 0.5 (tree per human) x 1.75 (increase of breathing rate between dogs and humans) = 0.875 (tree per dog). 900,000,000 (number of dogs) x 0.875 (tree per dog) = 787,500,000 or 787.5 million trees (for every dog on Earth).

### Entry 7, November 22-24, 2018 ###

#### Livestock ####

Today there are about 1.5 billion cows on Earth who breathe 60 times per minute. 60 (breathing rate of cows) / 20 (breathing rate of humans) = 3. Since there is half tree per human: 0.5 (tree per human) x 1.25 (increase of breathing rate between cows and humans) = 1.5 (tree per cow). 1,500,000,000 (number of cows) x 1.5 (tree per cow) = 2,250,000,000 or 2.25 billion trees (for every cow on Earth).

####  Jungle animals ####

There is about 236 thousand chimpanzes in the world who breathe 25 times per minute. 25 (breathing rate of chimpanzes) / 20 (breathing rate of humans) = 1.25. Since there is half tree per human: 0.5 (tree per human) x 1.25 (increase of breathing rate between chimpanzes and humans) = 0.625 (tree per chimpanze). 236,000 (number of chimpanzes) x 0.625 (tree per chimpanze) = 147,500 or 147.5 thousand trees (for every chimpanze on Earth).

### Entry 10, december 2nd - december 9th ###

#### Most abundant mamals ####

There are about 850 million goats in the World who breath at an average of 20 breaths per minute. As goats' repiration rate is the same as humans' they both use half a tree each. 850,000,000 (number of goats) x 0.5 (rate of tree per goat) = 425,000,000 or 425 million trees are needed for every goat on Earth.

There are about 13.239 million duikers on Earth who breath 20 times a minute. Since duiker's breathing rate is the same as humans the tree to duiker ratio is 0.5 so 13,239,000 x 0.5 = 6,619,500 or about 6.6 million tree (for every duiker on Earth).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_even-toed_ungulates_by_population

There are about 5 million gazelles/ antelopes on Earth who breathe about 16 breathes per minute while resting. 16 (breathing rate of gazelles) / 20 (breathing rate of humans) = 0.8. Since there is half tree per human: 0.5 (tree per human) x 0.8 (increase of breathing rate between gazelles and humans) = 0.4 (tree per gazelle). 5,000,000 (number of gazelles) x 0.4 (tree per gazelle) = 2,000,000 or 2 million trees (for every gazelle on Earth).
