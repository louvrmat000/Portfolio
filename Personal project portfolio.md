## The oxygen of trees and how much is it? ##

### RULES (entry 1), October 26, 2018 ###

My research question is: How many trees do we need to sustain the current animal population?

I WILL be ignoring other photosynthetic plants.

I WILL not be subtracting oxygen for plants or vegetation as they produce their oxygen (except trees).

I WILL not be counting sea creatures (including crabs, lobsters, alligators, etc.) (they have algae).

I WILL not be counting insects.

My goal is not to get every species of animals but rather their genuses.

I WILL not be counting artic animals either.

My goal is to get a pretty precise answer and then compare it to the number of trees currently.

Every animal's breath will be taken as if they are at rest.

Please email me at: matthieu.louvrier@live.com if I forget something.

### Criterion B: Planning ###

Checklist:

Aesthetics will be added on later, but they will be added.

Cost: A lot of time.

User/ Audience: Anyone who wishes to learn about trees and our planet (6+ years old to understand).

Environmental considerations: this is for the environment, and we should strive for at least twice the number of trees here.

Function: This project's function is to make us learn about the environment, it will be hard to maintain the ideal number of trees since humans are greedy for wood. However, it is possible if enough effort is put in

Materials: Wood/ paper ironically to make the poster board.

Size/Content: There will be a number of trees REQUIRED to keep us from dying but apart from that nothing.

Impact: I want this to inspire people to help trees and plant some, no one wants to die from suffocation.

First up determining how much oxygen trees produce.

On average a tree produces 260 pounds of oxygen each year, or enough oxygen for two people.

### Entry 4, October 26, 2018 ###

Second, the most important animal, humans, how much oxygen do they breathe?

Humans use 7-8 liters a minute while resting. However since the air is 20% oxygen and our breath is 15% oxygen, we consume 5% of it or 1/4 of the oxygen in that air therefore out of 100% of air swallowed only 5% is used. 11000 (100% of the air breathed in) x 5% (oxygen used) = 550 litters.

A tree produces 260 pounds of oxygen each year. A human uses 550 litters a day x 365 (days in a year) is about 200750 litters a year. A tree produces enough oxygen for two people, so a tree produces about 401500 litters (200750 x 2) a year or 1100 litters (401500 / 360) a day.

### Entry 5, October 26, 2018 ###

#### General info ####

There are 3.04 trillion or 3,000,000,000,000 trees in the world.

There are about 7.6 billion or 7,600,000,000 people on earth since one tree produces enough oxygen for two people about 3.8 billion trees are needed to sustain just humans.\

#### close domesticated animals ####

There are about 900 million dogs in the world who breath 35 times per minute. 35 (breathing rate of dogs) / 20 (breathing rate of humans) = 1.75. Since there is half tree per human: 0.5 (tree per human) x 1.75 (increase of breathing rate between dogs and humans) = 0.875 (tree per dog). 900,000,000 (number of dogs) x 0.875 (tree per dog) = 787,500,000 or 787.5 million trees (for every dog on earth).

There are about 600 million cats in the world who breathe 25 times per minute. 25 (breathing rate of cats) / 20 (breathing rate of humans) = 1.25. Since there is half tree per human: 0.5 (tree per human) x 1.25 (increase of breathing rate between cats and humans) = 0.625 (tree per cat). 600,000,000 (number of cats) x 0.625 (tree per cat) = 375,000,000 or 375 million trees (for every cat on earth).

#### Livestock ####

Today there are about 1.5 billion cows on earth who breathe 60 times per minute. 60 (breathing rate of cows) / 20 (breathing rate of humans) = 3. Since there is half tree per human: 0.5 (tree per human) x 1.25 (increase of breathing rate between cows and humans) = 1.5 (tree per cow). 1,500,000,000 (number of cows) x 1.5 (tree per cow) = 2,250,000,000 or 2.25 billion trees (for every cow on earth).

There are about 2 billion pigs who breathe 15 times per minute. 15 (breathing rate of pigs) / 20 (breathing rate of humans) = 0.75. Since there is half tree per human: 0.5 (tree per human) x 0.75 (increase of breathing rate between pigs and humans) = 0.375 (tree per pig). 2,000,000,000 (number of pigs) x 0.375 (tree per pig) = 750,000,000 or 750 million trees (for every pig on earth).

There are about 19 billion chickens on earth who breathe 21 times per minute. 21 (breathing rate of chickens) / 20 (breathing rate of humans) = 1.05. Since there is half tree per human: 0.5 (tree per human) x 1.05 (increase of breathing rate between chickens and humans) = 0.525 (tree per chicken). 19,000,000,000 (number of chickens) x 0.525 (tree per chicken) = 9,975,000,000 or 9.975 billion trees (for every chicken on earth).
