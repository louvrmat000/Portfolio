## Setup ##

### RULES (entry 1), October 26, 2018 ###

My research question is: How many trees do we need to sustain the current animal population?

I WILL be ignoring other photosynthetic plants.

I WILL not be subtracting oxygen for plants or vegetation as they produce their oxygen (except trees).

I WILL not be counting sea creatures (including crabs, lobsters, alligators, etc.) (they have algue).

I WILL not be counting insects.

My goal is not to get every species of animals but rather the ones who have an impact (at least 1,000,000 + individuals)

My goal is to get a pretty precise answer and then compare it to the number of trees currently.

Every animal's breath will be taken as if they are at rest.

Please email me at: louvrmat000@mysbisd.org if I forget something.

### Entry 2, November, 1st ###

### Criterion A: Inquiring and analysing ###

Explain and justify the need:

We need to able to say that we do or don't have enought trees for our planet, especially if we don't have enought because we would slowly run out of oxygen and many of us would asfixiate.

Identify and Prioritise research:

I need a reliable source to tell me about animals and how much are there telling me how important they are. Next comes the research about how they breathe.

Analyse existing product:

I have not found any sources or blog or websites attempting what I am doing and that is why I chose this task, so that we may know something important.

Develop a design brief:

Target Consumer: Anyone who will hear and listen

Problem Statement: We humans are in charge of Earth, most of the time we control what happens on this planet and so it is also our duty to protect it and to make sure the planet does not suffer espeicially by our hands, making it lack oxygen is the worst because we will be affecting in a bad way all multicellular organisms!

Design statement: I will continue and build up a website that desplay the ammount of oxygen needed for our current animal population.


### Criterion B: Planning ###

Develop a design specification:

Display a number of trees, has entries staiting what I did and why

Develop Design ideas:

Have a big number, small entries

have a small number but bigger entries

Present the the chosen design:

To have a big number for it is more powerfull and my entries are only for the curious ones

Develop planning drawings or diagrams:

### November 31st ###

### Criterion C: Creating the solution ###

changes: 

- I switched it from life to only animal species on land due to intervening factors like photosynthetic plant, tiny bugs and sea animals

follow the plan to make the solution:

- I am steadily working towords my goal by working a little bit by a little bit

Demonstrating technical skills:

- I have perseverance because I did want to give up multiple times

- I have reasearching skill because this information isn't easy to find

- I can build a potfolio from nothing on a website.

Construct a logical plan:

- work with big animal population, work my way down so I don't spend more time than needed on something with a population 1,000,000 while I haven't done humans.

- get as close to the result as possible and make my personal project poster board.

### Criterion D: Evaluating ###

Impact of the solution:

- Raise awarness to potential lack of trees

How could it be improved:

- adding other photosynthetic plants

- adding more species

Success of the solution:

- It might get people to care about and plant trees

Design, Testing, Methods Development, Planning:

- I designed this website

- I tested multiple sources and found the best

- My methods could be improved however with my reasources I think this is the best.

- I planned to do the biggest animals first then work my way down

## Trees, Oxygen, and animals ##

### Entry 3, October 25, 2018 ###

First up determining how much oxygen trees produce.

On average a tree produces 260 pounds of oxygen each year, or enough oxygen for two people.

### Entry 4, October 26, 2018 ###

Second, the most important animal, humans, how much oxygen do they breathe?

Humans use 7-8 liters a minute while resting. However since the air is 20% oxygen and our breath is 15% oxygen, we consume 5% of it or 1/4 of the oxygen in that air therefore out of 100% of air swallowed only 5% is used. 11000 (100% of the air breathed in) x 5% (oxygen used) = 550 liters.

A tree produces 260 pounds of oxygen each year. A human uses 550 litters a day x 365 (days in a year) is about 200750 liters a year. A tree produces enough oxygen for two people, so a tree produces about 401500 liters (200750 x 2) a year or 1100 litters (401500 / 360) a day.

80 (average human heartbeat per minute) / 20 (average human breathing rate) = 4 (ratio of repiration rate to heart beat)
Only be used when I don't know the repiration rate.;

### Entry 5, October 26, 2018 ###

#### General info ####

There are 3.04 trillion or 3,000,000,000,000 trees in the world.

There are about 7.6 billion or 7,600,000,000 people on Earth now however, the human population is growing rapidly and it is estimated to be 9 billion in as soon as 2050 so I will use 9 billion rather than 7.6 billion. Since for every human half a tree is needed, 9,000,000,000 (number of humans estimated for 2050) x 0.5 (trees per human ratio) = 4,500,000,000 or 4.5 billion trees.

### Entry 7, december 2nd - december 9th 2018###

#### Most abundant mamals ####

Today there are about 1.5 billion cows on Earth who breathe 60 times per minute. 60 (breathing rate of cows) / 20 (breathing rate of humans) = 3. Since there is half tree per human: 0.5 (tree per human) x 1.25 (increase of breathing rate between cows and humans) = 1.5 (tree per cow). 1,500,000,000 (number of cows) x 1.5 (tree per cow) = 2,250,000,000 or 2.25 billion trees (for every cow on Earth).

There are about 13.239 million duikers on Earth who breath 20 times a minute. Since duiker's breathing rate is the same as humans the tree to duiker ratio is 0.5 so 13,239,000 x 0.5 = 6,619,500 or about 6.6 million tree (for every duiker on Earth).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_even-toed_ungulates_by_population

There are about 5 million gazelles/ antelopes on Earth who breathe about 16 breathes per minute while resting. 16 (breathing rate of gazelles) / 20 (breathing rate of humans) = 0.8. Since there is half tree per human: 0.5 (tree per human) x 0.8 (increase of breathing rate between gazelles and humans) = 0.4 (tree per gazelle). 5,000,000 (number of gazelles) x 0.4 (tree per gazelle) = 2,000,000 or 2 million trees (for every gazelle on Earth).
