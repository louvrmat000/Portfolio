## The oxygen of trees and how much is it? ##

### RULES (entry 1), October 26, 2018 ###

My reasearch question is: How many trees do we need to sustain the current animal propulation?

I WILL be ignoring other photosynthetic plants.

I WILL not be subtracting oxygen for plants or vegetation as they produce their own oxygen (exept trees).

I WILL not be counting sea creatures (including crabs, lobsters, aligators, etc.) (they have algae).

I WILL not be counting insects.

I WILL not get every species of animals but rather their genus.

I WILL not be counting artic animals either.

Basically I will only be counting the Animalia kingdom with some exeptions.

My goal is to get a pretty presise answer and then compare it to the number of trees currently.

Every animal's breath will be taken as if they are at rest.

Any information here will be from google .

### Entry 2, November, 1st ###

### Criterion B: Planning ###

Checklist:

Aethetics will be added on later but they will be added.

Cost: A lot of time.

User/ Audience: Anyone who wishes to learn about trees and our plannet (6+ years old to understand).

Environmental considerations: this is for the environment, and we should strive for at least twice the number of trees here.

Function: This project's function is to make us learn about the environment, it will be hard to maintain the ideal number of trees since humans are greedy for wood however it is very possible if enought effort is put in

Materials: Wood/ paper ironically to make the poster board.

Size/Content: Yes, there will be an amount of trees REQUIERED to keep us from dying but apart from that nothing.

Impact: I want theis to inspire people to help trees and plant some, no one wants to die from suffication.

First up determining how much oxygen trees produce.

On average a tree produces 260 pounds of oxygen each year, or enought oxygen for two people.

Second, the most important animal, humans, how much oxygen do they breathe?

Humans use 7-8 liters a minute while resting. However since the air is 20% oxygen and our breath is 15% oxygen, we consume 5% of it or 1/4 of the oxygen in that air therefore out of 100% of air swallowed only 5% is used. 11000 (100% of the air breathed in) x 5% (oxygen used) = 550 litters.

A tree produces 260 pounds of oxygen each year. A human uses 600 (rounded because of exercise) litters a day x 365 (days in a year) is about 219000 litters a year. A tree produces enought oxygen for two people so a tree produces about 438000 litters (219000 x 2) a year or 1200 litters (438000 / 360) a day.

### Entry 5, October 26, 2018###

#### General info ####

There are 3.04 trillion or 3,000,000,000,000 trees in the world.

There are about 7.6 billion or 7,600,000,000 people on earth, since 1 tree produces enought oxygen for two people about 3.8 billion trees are needed to sustain just humans.
