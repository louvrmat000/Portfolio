## The oxygen of trees and how much is it? ##

### RULES (entry 1), October 26, 2018 ###

My reasearch question is: How many trees do we need to sustain the current animal propulation?

I WILL be ignoring other photosynthetic plants.

I WILL not be subtracting oxygen for plants or vegetation as they produce their own oxygen (exept trees).

I WILL not be counting sea creatures (including crabs, lobsters etc.) (they have algue).

My goal is to get a pretty presise answer and then compare it to the number of trees currently.

Every animal's breath will be taken as if they are at rest.

Any information here will be from google .

First up determining how much oxygen trees produce.

On average a tree produces 260 pounds of oxygen each year!

Second, the most important animal, humans, how much oxygen do they breathe?

7-8 liters a minute while resting this would total to about 11000. however the air is 20% oxygen and our breath is 15% oxygen so we consume 5% of it or 1/4 of the oxygen in that air. Humans consume 5% of oxygen in each breath therefore out of 100% only 5% is use, 11000 (100% of the air) x 5% (oxygen used) = 550 (what resting humans consume everyday).This means that humans consume about 550 liters of pure oxygen a day.
