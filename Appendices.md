I started my project today, and I thought a good topic would be about how many trees we need, I see not many people caring about nature, due to the fact that enought people litter for it to be a problem, people are often forced or kind enough to pick up other people's trash in the streets. People also don't seem a fan of the idea of replanting trees, I know that the profit from cutting down trees is high, and I don't ask you to stop but rather to replant afterwards, it'll  take a 100 years for that tree to regrow so it won't even be a problem for those plant them on top of costing a measly 10 cents. I want to find out how many trees we need to survive since the number of trees on Earth have halfed since our 'creation' or appearence. And so since in 2050, the human population is estimated to grow to 9,000,000,000 and the number of animals is likely not to grow I have decided to take 9 billion as the number of humans so we have time to react before all our oxygen run out, suffocation is a terrible way to die.

Today I sat down and decide to know what actually made my project was actually about and what I was going to do

#### divider

Get to know the number of trees needed to sustain us

Get to the end of the project and get an answer.

#### divider

Get an answer that comes for calculations rather then imagination          

My work needs to be credible, and the only way is with math.

#### divider

Get only important animals and don't worry about others                    

There are many animals however, I only have time for so many.

#### divider

Make a good conclusion that makes people want to act                       

I need to get my message across, and get people acting.

#### divider`

Have fun and enjoy learning about the project                              

This project is to explore a liked topic not to hate it.

#### divider

Make comprehensible and resonable arguments.                               

Make my conclusion have coherance, it must make people act or                                                                            want to act.

Today I started working more seriously on my project, thanks partly to my parents who told me to get on with it so I could be done with it, So from today on I will work at least two hours per weekend which is completly resonable and will allow me to finish my project way before the due deadline. Today I also found some nice sources that will help me with my project in terms of what I need to do and how I will do it.
