I started my project today, and I thought a good topic would be about how many trees we need, I see not many people caring about nature, due to the fact that enought people litter for it to be a problem, people are often forced or kind enough to pick up other people's trash in the streets. People also don't seem a fan of the idea of replanting trees, I know that the profit from cutting down trees is high, and I don't ask you to stop but rather to replant afterwards, it'll  take a 100 years for that tree to regrow so it won't even be a problem for those plant them on top of costing a measly 10 cents. I want to find out how many trees we need to survive since the number of trees on Earth have halfed since our 'creation' or appearence. And so since in 2050, the human population is estimated to grow to 9,000,000,000 and the number of animals is likely not to grow I have decided to take 9 billion as the number of humans so we have time to react before all our oxygen run out, suffocation is a terrible way to die.
