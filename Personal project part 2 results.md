##### 30,234,694,400 ######

The current aproximation of the number of trees is 3 trillion or 3,000,000,000,000.

30,234,694,400 / 3,000,000,000,000 = 0.01007823146 or 1.007823146 %

Still roughtly the same overall percentage as with part 1, exept now it makes way more sense, a cow uses way more as everyone which makes sense considering how many they are and how heavy they are.

#### KEEP IN MIND THIS IS IF ALL ANIMALS ARE RESTING, it may be way more as our breathing rate more than double when we, humans are exercising ####

I think it is more likely for us to use 3 % when we include all other species.
